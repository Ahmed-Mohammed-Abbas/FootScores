This is the first application I, Reali22, have developed to display the results of currently ongoing matches in a simple and smooth manner, so you don't need to use your phone while following the matches.
For Enigma2 devices.
The application was built, and the plugin was tested on my personal device VU+ Zero4k.

Note: You need an API key for the plugin to work by registering on the www.football-data.org/client/register website.
The process is easy; you just need to register on the site, and the key will be sent to your email.

Enter the API key when running the plugin by pressing the blue button on the remote control.
You can choose matches according to each tournament by pressing the red button on the remote control.
You can also change the display of match results as a bar at the bottom of the screen by pressing the green button on the remote control.
You can also display results for ongoing matches only by pressing the yellow button on the remote control.

Download plugin.py from the repo.
